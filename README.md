# Optimal Control
The aim of this project, within the scope of the curricular unit Optimal Control (taught at Instituto Superior Técnico), is to control the drone Parrot Mambo Fly, through an autonomous controller, so that the drone follows a predefined trajectory.
Previously, the subsystems that compose the drone were studied, its linearity, stability, controllability and observability were analysed, and two Simulink models were created, one linear and one non-linear, which describe its dynamics.
We designed and implemented, in the linear and non-linear models, an optimal observer and controller that allow the drone to follow a reference.
These should be robust to disturbances that would affect the drone in real life, such as noise in sensor measurements and external disturbances.
